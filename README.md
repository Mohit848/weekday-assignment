Steps to run the project on your local machine
1. Open/Clone project to local
2. Open terminal and run  -
   a. npm install
   b. npm run dev (To run dev setup on local)

Note - Tech Stack filter feature is not added as I had already sent a query to Anubhav but didn't get any response yet. Also, in API data Tech Stack and JdRole is contradiciting.
